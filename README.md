# Functions for polynomials :  
  
*I had a test on polynomials in c, I thought that it would be good to share it, even if it's not exactly what I write in my copy :(*  
  
* poly.c is the file with the implementations of the functions declared in poly.h
* poly.h is the file with the declarations of the functions implemented in poly.c (was the subject of my test, you can take it to test your skills)  
* makefile is the file to compile all of that  
* main.c (thanks ChatGPT) is everything you will need to test your functions, there is a print_poly function and a create poly function

If you reuse my work, please credit me, I won't be mad if you don't but it would be cool if you did !
